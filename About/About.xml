  <description>Tweak some aspects of Sanguophages, both from Biotech and from some mods.

  Biotech
  =======
  - Modify the amount of hemogen a pawn gains by its body size (larger pawns gain less, smaller pawns gain more).
    - The effect of body size caps at body sizes of 0.2 and 10.
    - Examples hemogen change modifiers:
      - Body size 0.8: 1.25x   (25% more)
      - Body size 6.5: ~0.15x  (15% as much)
  - The amount of hemogen a Sanguophage gains from feeding on a pawn is no longer modified by the body size of the
    victim. VRE - S made it so the amount of blood a pawn looses when being fed on is modified by its body size, which
    implies the volume of blood extracted by the Sanguophage is constant. I like this interpretation better than
    vanilla's, which implies a Sanguophage always drinks a specific percentage of a pawn's blood.
    - Note that this change makes it harder for Sanguophages to fill up on hemogen, but in vanilla Sanguophages can not
      feed on animals nor are there many pawns with a larger body size (or a much larger body size), so its effect is
      minimal. With, for example, mods that add genes to modify a human pawn's body size in either direction, or when
      using VRE - S to feed on animals, this change will have much more of an effect.
  - A pawn that is incapable of violence will not be able to feed on a pawn who would then have life threatening or
    lethal blood loss.
    - For now, this does *not* take into account body size of the target, as I want it to match as closely as possible
      to when a confirmation box would appear for causing life threatening or lethal blood loss.

  Vanilla Races Expanded - Sanguophage
  ====================================
  - Add a recipe to perform a blood transfusion to animals using animal blood.
    - The amount of blood gained is modified by the body size of the animal.
  - Add a recipe to extract an animal hemogen pack from an animal.
   - The amount of blood lost is modified by the body size of the animal.</description>
